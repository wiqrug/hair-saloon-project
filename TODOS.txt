Check if its possible to make the navbar stay at the top 0 position when mouse is scrolling down instead of 1.

Using mobile first approach, continue creating each page seperately.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


mobile navbar has no animation when it closes, it could have one.



next step is to:

    ~ Add navigation for each component and just test it with a sample div.
    ~ If it works, start with one page, for example contact us. And make these reusable.
    ~ Also while creating these pages, i need to also create the footer which will be common for all pages.
