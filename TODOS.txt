Check if its possible to make the navbar stay at the top 0 position when mouse is scrolling down instead of 1.

Using mobile first approach, continue creating each page seperately.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


mobile navbar has no animation when it closes, it could have one.



next step is to:
        ~Create each page seperately, with reusable code
        ~Navbar should stay on top while scrolling. Fix this!
        ~Maybe adjust paths to have 2 languages depending on the users choice.
        ~Think about adding a timer to navbar (to close after 5seconds)


Add pages folder and seperate pages from components, so navbar_components doesnt need to exist as a folder
